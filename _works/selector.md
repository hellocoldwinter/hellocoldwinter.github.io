**CONTEXT** <br>
Sometimes it is difficult to come to a mutual agreement regarding what to do together. This decision is even harder to make if it is a big group of people. Some examples could be choosing which games on Steam to play together, which movies on Netflix to create a watch party for, or even what to do in general. Not only making the decision, coming up with a list of options in the first place can be a challenge as well.
<br>
The app will offer users a way to customize their list of options -whatever it is. It needs to be fun to use as well because the process of picking something over something else is already a heated discussion where most people want their choice to be picked. It will also need a recommendation feature for users who just want suggestions.
