**CONTEXT** <br>
Sometimes it is difficult to come to a mutual agreement regarding what to do together. This decision is even harder to make if it is a big group of people. Some examples could be choosing which games on Steam to play together, which movies on Netflix to create a watch party for, or even what to do in general. Not only making the decision, coming up with a list of options in the first place can be a challenge as well.
<br>
The app will offer users a way to customize their list of options -whatever it is. It needs to be fun to use as well because the process of picking something over something else is already a heated discussion where most people want their choice to be picked. It will also need a recommendation feature for users who just want suggestions. 
<br><br>

**FUNCTIONALITY** <br>
* Help people make their choices among various options in different categories (restaurants, movies, games, traveling destinations…) using different methods - Swiping, Dice, Randomize
* Share list between users using links
* Provide recommendations/list of options for users if they don’t have any idea in mind (restaurants, movies, games, traveling destinations…)
<br><br>

**TARGET AUDIENCE** <br>
Anyone who wants to spend time with their friends/family and has a hard time deciding what to do among a list of options and/or anyone who needs suggestions regarding what to do and open to exploring new options.
<br><br>

**DESIGN CHOICE** <br><br>
<ins>Approach 1: Recommendations are randomly generated</ins>
> Customers are presented with different categories (movies, games, restaurants, events…)
Customers choose the category based on what they want to do with their friends/family. <br>
> The app will provide customers some basic filters to narrow down their list. <br>
> The app then proceeds to send a request to external APIs to get data based on the user’s filters then randomize and put them into a list. 
<br>
<ins>Rationale for approach 1:</ins>
> The list is not completely random, rather, it takes the user’s preference/restrictions into consideration. This approach generally offers a great customization/personalization capability. <br>
> This approach saves customers’ time by not forcing them to actually come up with ideas. <br>
> This approach also opens a possibility that customers would have some new and interesting options that they may not think about. <br>
